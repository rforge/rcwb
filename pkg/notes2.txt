I just noticed that rcqp seems to have the same limitations as CQi
generally. Is there any way to do a "undump" or to "set target", "sort
...", "randomize", etc.? Would it be difficult to implement those
functions as well?

-----

best thing to do is to search another way. You cannot read a dump (with
undump) but you can save a R subcorpus object with save() and re-read it
with load().

Yes, but I cannot run an query on my saved subcorpus anymore - or can I?
