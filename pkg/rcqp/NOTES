In order to reuse the cwb code base the following edition have to be made:

- Comment out the first three functions in:
src/cwb/cqp/hash.c

- Comment out (in C style comment) the following line (at the very top of the file) in src/cwb/cl/attributes.c
#include <ctype.h>

- Change C++ style into C style comments mainly in :
  cwb/cqp/corpmanag.c:40:1: warning: C++ style comments are not allowed in ISO C90
  cwb/cqp/output.c:251: warning: ISO C90 forbids mixed declarations and code

- cwb/cqp/output.c:251: warning: ISO C90 forbids mixed declarations and code
