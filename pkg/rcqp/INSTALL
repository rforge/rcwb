This document explains how to compile the rcqp extension for R on a Unix like 
system, including Mac OS X.



Prerequisites
=============

Building tools necessary:
 - GCC 3.3 or newer recommended (other ANSI C compilers might also work)
 - the ar and ranlib code archive utilities
 - GNU make or a compatible program
 - GNU bison & flex to generate the parsers
 - the pkg-config program

Obviously R must be installed on your system since rcqp is designed to be 
an R extension and the compiling process needs to read the R headers.

Additionnally two external libraries are necessary to compile the CWB 
source code:
 - the PCRE library: at least version 7 is recommended.
   It is available to download from this address:
        http://www.pcre.org/

 - the Glib library: at least version 2 is required.
   It is available to download from this address:
        http://www.gtk.org/download.html

Mac OS X notes
==============

Installing PCRE and Glib can be done using the MacPorts system. If 
MacPorts is installed on your system, you just have to type the following 
commands in a Terminal window in order to download, compile and install 
the PCRE and the Glib libraries :
	sudo port -v install pcre
	sudo port -v install glib2
